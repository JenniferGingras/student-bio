            <!--One to two paragraphs about student-->
            <p>Jennifer is one half of a pair of twins. Her sister looks exactly like her. Jennifer is often considered to be the evil twin.</p>
            <P>Jennifer is not actually evil. She likes to read books with happy endings, but she also likes books by Shirley Jackson. She also likes to design books, play with type and sit on the floor to hang out with cats.</P>
